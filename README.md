# Hockey Data Analysis Project

## Introduction

This project aims to analyze hockey game data using various statistical and machine learning techniques to gain insights into team performance, player behavior, and game outcomes. The following techniques will be employed for analysis:

### Techniques Used

1. **Regression Analysis:** Predict game outcomes, player/team performance, and game conditions based on dataset information such as events, goals, clock, period, and details.
   
2. **Classification Algorithms:** Utilize logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, and classification trees to classify game outcomes. Events can also be classified based on coordinate information.


## Team Strategy Analysis

### Offensive Strategies

- **Shots Analysis:** Track the number of shots attempted by each team, focusing on shots on goal, missed shots, and blocked shots. Analyze shot locations to identify high-danger areas for scoring opportunities.

- **Passing Analysis:** Monitor successful pass attempts and puck movement to assess possession and offensive playmaking. Examine types of passes and their accuracy to gauge passing efficiency.

### Defensive Strategies

- **Puck Recoveries:** Evaluate how quickly a team regains possession after a turnover, indicating defensive resilience and transition effectiveness.

- **Takeaways:** Measure defensive pressure and ability to disrupt opponent's plays through takeaways.

## Data Modification

To analyze team performance comprehensively, modifications will be made to the dataset. Subsets will be generated grouping data by teams (Home/Away/Team), event, date, and period. The number of each event that each team is involved in will be calculated, along with average player coordinates during events.

## Conclusion

This project provides a comprehensive analysis of hockey game data using statistical and machine learning techniques. By examining team strategies and player behavior, valuable insights can be gained into game outcomes and performance dynamics.
